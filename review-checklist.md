#Checklist for review of Content Types


## Content Types background
Before we can develop review checklists for various types of content, we need to
have a clear idea of the types of content we expect to support.  As of the writing of this document, our understanding of our content types was described in the [What to Contribute](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/91648f8f992639ad8a9f5467e00cf6dc1bec21a7/WhatToContribute.md) document.

Please note that there is another PR/issue in the works which attempts to revise the content types and their attributes. The current link is as follows for this document: [content types and their attributes](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/markcmiller86-content-types-doc/Site/ContentTypes.md) document.

- [x] Grammar and syntax
