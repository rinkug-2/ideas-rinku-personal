# What is PSIP?

Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) is a lightweight, iterative workflow that allows software development teams to identify development bottlenecks and track progress to overcome them. 

By practicing PSIP, teams are able to realize process improvements without a disruption to any current development processes. 

# Who and why should one be interested in PSIP?

If you want to improve your team's development process, software sustainability and productivity but in a lightweight, iterative and uncumbersome manner, then PSIP is for YOU!

Scientists, researchers and scientific software teams who work in scientific computing do wish to improve their (team's) development process, software sustainability and productivity. However, they may face several realistic constraints, as observed below: 

1.  Scientific software teams are *typically* focused on obtaining scientific results from the software they write. While sometimes funding is directed towards writing pure software, in most cases, funding is *usually* for generating results, not software. 

2. Funding/Executing research plan/Getting results is a competitive process and teams cannot usually expend much time or effort outside of writing the software features that support generating new results. 

3. Scientific software teams typically have modest formal software engineering training. They may be aware of formal terminology such as software lifecycle, requirements elicitation and technical debt, but often have incomplete or incorrect understanding on how to implement these.

4. Many scientific teams have an inherent skepticism about formal, heavyweight approaches that might significantly delay their current scientific activities or require large investments before seeing benefits.

Keeping in mind the above observations, for any productivity or sustainability improvements to be successful, they MUST BE incremental and integrated into the primary feature development process. And in this context, a lightweight, adaptable, iterative and informal approach to improving developer productivity and software sustainability is necessary. Such an approach is PSIPs!


# What does PSIPs entail?

PSIPs is very lightweight. 

PSIP utilizes progress tracking cards (PTC). Progress tracking cards are concise visual aids that record your goals, deliverables, and milestones to internally compare your team's progress toward an intended goal. PSIP PTCs are not meant to be external assessments or evaluation tools. PSIP can help develop best practices and the use of PTCs will help keep track of your progress toward an objective. You can also use or share PTCs when communicating to other teams about your goals and how you know when you will have met your objectives.

# When should I practice PSIP?

Of course PSIP can be initiated at anytime, and we find PSIP is especially helpful when you or your team are 1) onboarding new team members unfamiliar with your current process, 2) your code has a new set of users/collaborators who need to understand your process for version control, and 3) the growth and success of your code base requires your team to interface with other teams more frequently. If any of these conditions describe your situation, we recommend you practice PSIP! Even if none of these conditions describe your situation, we still recommend you practice PSIP to upgrade team practices anytime!
